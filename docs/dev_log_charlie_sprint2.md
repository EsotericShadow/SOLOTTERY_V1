# Developer Log - Charlie - Sprint 2

**Sprint Goal:** Testnet Deployment, Frontend Integration & System Testing (QA & Testing Focus)

**Date:** May 11, 2025

## Task 2.9: Integrated System Testing (with Alice, Bob, Eve)

**Overall Objective:** Execute the test plan defined in `integrated_system_testing_strategy.md` to ensure the application is functional, reliable, and secure on the testnet.

### Sub-task 2.9.1: Execute Test Cases from `integrated_system_testing_strategy.md`
- [ ] **Lottery Lifecycle Testing:**
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Initialization (Admin initializes `LotteryConfig`).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Round Start (Admin starts a new lottery round, frontend updates).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: User Entry (Wallet connection, view details, successful entry, fee deduction, participant list update, insufficient SOL, entry after round end, multiple users).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Draw Conduction (Admin triggers draw, winner selection, frontend updates, draw before end time/no participants).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Prize Distribution (Admin triggers distribution, prize transfers, frontend updates, balance verification on explorer).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Post-Distribution State (System ready for new round).
- [ ] **Configuration Management Testing:**
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Admin updates `LotteryConfig` (entry fee, dev wallet), verify changes.
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Admin pauses/unpauses lottery, verify entry disabled/enabled.
- [ ] **UI/UX Testing:**
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Wallet connection/disconnection smoothness.
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Accuracy and updates of data displays (pot, time, participants, past results).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Responsive design across different screen sizes (conceptual check).
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Clarity and helpfulness of error messages.
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Informativeness of loading states.
- [ ] **Security Testing (Scenario-based from strategy):**
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Non-admin attempts admin functions.
    - [ ] Test Case Group: Attempt to manipulate entry/draw process (as feasible on testnet).
- [ ] **Compatibility Testing (Conceptual Check):**
    - [ ] Note any obvious issues if testing on different available browser environments (if possible in sandbox or through simulation).
- [ ] **Performance Testing (Basic Observations):**
    - [ ] Note frontend responsiveness during interactions.
    - [ ] Note transaction confirmation times.

### Sub-task 2.9.2: Log Bugs and Track Fixes
- [ ] Establish a system/document for logging bugs (e.g., shared spreadsheet: `sprint2_bug_log.md`).
- [ ] For each bug: Description, Steps to Reproduce, Severity, Priority, Status (Open, In Progress, Fixed, Verified).
- [ ] Communicate bugs clearly to Alice (smart contract) and Bob (frontend).
- [ ] Track bug fixing progress.

### Sub-task 2.9.3: Perform Regression Testing
- [ ] After bugs are reported as fixed by developers:
    - [ ] Re-test the specific bug to confirm the fix.
    - [ ] Test related areas of the application to ensure no new issues were introduced by the fix.

## Task (Supporting Task 2.10): Support Bug Fixing and Refinement
- [ ] Provide detailed information to developers to help reproduce and understand bugs.
- [ ] Verify fixes promptly.

**Testing Documentation to be referenced/created:**
*   `integrated_system_testing_strategy.md` (Reference)
*   `sprint2_test_cases_detailed.md` (To be created if more granularity needed than strategy doc)
*   `sprint2_bug_log.md` (To be created for tracking)
*   `sprint2_test_summary_report.md` (To be created at end of Sprint 2)
