## Development Log - Solana Weekly Lottery - Frontend Sprint 1

**Date:** May 11, 2025
**Developer:** Bob (Frontend), with support from Alice (Smart Contract) and Frank (DevOps/Git)

### Progress:

*   **Task 1.6: Frontend - Wallet Connection (Phantom)**
    *   Successfully installed Solana wallet adapter dependencies (`@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`, `@solana/web3.js`).
    *   Created `WalletContextProvider.tsx` to wrap the application and provide wallet state.
    *   Integrated `WalletContextProvider` into `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    *   Created `WalletConnectButton.tsx` using `<WalletMultiButton />` for UI.
    *   Added `WalletConnectButton` to `src/app/page.tsx` and verified basic connection/disconnection UI flow.

*   **Task (Implied from Step 003): Implement Frontend Lottery UI Components**
    *   Created `LotteryStatusCard.tsx` to display current lottery pot, time remaining, round ID, and user entries (using mock data).
    *   Created `ParticipantsList.tsx` to display a list of participants and their entry counts (using mock data).
    *   Created `PastLotteryResults.tsx` to display results from previous lottery rounds in an accordion view (using mock data).
    *   Integrated these components into `src/app/page.tsx` with appropriate layout and styling, showing conditional rendering based on wallet connection.

*   **Task (Implied from Step 004): Implement Frontend Transaction Handling for `enter_lottery`**
    *   Created `src/idl` directory and copied `solana_lottery_contract.json` (smart contract IDL) into it.
    *   Created `src/lib/solanaLotteryHooks.ts` with a `useSolanaLottery` custom hook.
    *   Implemented `getProvider` and `getProgram` utility functions within the hook.
    *   Implemented the `enterLottery` async function in the hook to:
        *   Derive PDAs for `lottery_config` and `lottery_round` (fetching `current_lottery_round_id` from a mocked/assumed config state).
        *   Call the `enterLottery` instruction on the smart contract.
        *   Handle transaction signing and submission.
        *   Provide basic console logging and `alert()` for success/error.
    *   Integrated `useSolanaLottery` hook into `src/app/page.tsx`.
    *   Updated the "Enter Lottery" button in `LotteryStatusCard.tsx` (and directly in `page.tsx`) to call the `handleEnterLottery` function which uses the hook.
    *   Added basic loading state (`isLoading`) to the "Enter Lottery" button.

*   **Task (Implied from Step 005): Test Frontend Integration**
    *   Attempted to build the smart contract using `anchor build` but encountered issues with `cargo-build-sbf` not being found in the sandbox environment.
    *   Attempted to install `cargo-build-sbf` but it was not found in the crates.io registry.
    *   Adapted testing strategy due to inability to deploy the smart contract locally:
        *   Started the Next.js frontend development server (`npm run dev`).
        *   Focused on testing UI interactions, wallet connection flow, and the frontend logic for initiating the `enter_lottery` transaction.
        *   Verified that clicking "Enter Lottery" calls the `enterLottery` function in the hook.
        *   Observed console logs indicating the attempt to interact with the (unavailable) smart contract and the resulting error messages being caught by the frontend's error handling (as expected).

### Issues & Challenges:

*   **Smart Contract Build Environment:** The primary challenge was the inability to build the Solana smart contract within the sandbox due to missing `cargo-build-sbf` tooling. This prevented full end-to-end testing with a locally deployed contract.
*   **Testing Limitations:** Consequently, testing was limited to frontend logic and simulated interactions. Actual on-chain transaction success and state changes could not be verified.
*   **Mock Data Dependency:** The UI currently relies on mock data. The next phase will require implementing functions to fetch live data from the smart contract.
*   **PDA Derivation for `lottery_round`:** The `enterLottery` hook currently assumes it can fetch `current_lottery_round_id` from the `LotteryConfig` account. This fetch logic needs to be robustly implemented once live data fetching is in place.

### Next Steps (as per `solana_lottery_development_plan.md`):

*   Deploy the `solana_lottery_contract` to a Solana testnet.
*   Update the frontend `PROGRAM_ID` and any endpoint configurations to point to the testnet deployment.
*   Implement functions in `solanaLotteryHooks.ts` to fetch live data from the smart contract (e.g., `LotteryConfig`, current `LotteryRound` details, participant entries, past results).
*   Replace mock data in `page.tsx` with live data.
*   Thoroughly test all functionalities on the testnet.
*   Proceed with further smart contract instructions (admin functions like `start_new_lottery_round`, `conduct_draw`, `distribute_prizes`) integration on the frontend.

This log summarizes the frontend development work for Sprint 1, focusing on wallet connection, UI display, and initial transaction capability for entering the lottery.
