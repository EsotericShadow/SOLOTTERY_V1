# Sprint 2 Status Report - Solana Weekly Lottery

**Date:** May 11, 2025

## Overall Sprint 2 Status

Sprint 2 is **partially complete**. We have made significant progress in frontend development by integrating mock data, allowing UI/UX refinement and testing to proceed. However, the core goal of deploying and initializing the smart contract on the testnet (Devnet) has encountered persistent technical challenges, which are currently blocking full backend integration and end-to-end system testing.

## Completed Tasks in Sprint 2

1.  **Documentation of Smart Contract Initialization Challenges:**
    *   A detailed document (`smart_contract_initialization_challenges.md`) has been created, outlining the persistent TypeScript errors (primarily `TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'lotteryConfig' does not exist...`) and the extensive troubleshooting steps undertaken. These steps included IDL examination, various naming convention attempts, admin keypair management strategies, smart contract rebuilds (`anchor build`, `anchor clean`), TypeScript environment checks, and script comparisons with working test files.

2.  **Proposal of Alternative Approaches for Testnet Deployment:**
    *   A document (`alternative_testnet_deployment_approaches.md`) was created, proposing several alternative strategies to overcome the initialization blocker. The primary recommendation is to leverage the Anchor Test Framework for initialization, adapting existing test scripts.

3.  **Frontend Integration with Mock Data:**
    *   A comprehensive mock data file (`/home/ubuntu/solana_lottery_app/frontend/solana_lottery_frontend/src/lib/mockData.ts`) was created, providing realistic data structures for lottery configuration, current and past lottery rounds, and user tickets.
    *   The main frontend page (`/home/ubuntu/solana_lottery_app/frontend/solana_lottery_frontend/src/app/page.tsx`) was successfully updated to import and utilize this mock data. This involved:
        *   Replacing placeholder mock data with the new, detailed mock structures.
        *   Implementing data transformations (e.g., lamports to SOL, timestamp to readable date/time).
        *   Simulating a lottery entry function that updates the UI state (pot amount, participant list, user entries) based on mock interactions, allowing for UI testing of this flow.

4.  **Limited System Testing (Frontend with Mock Data):**
    *   The frontend components (`LotteryStatusCard`, `ParticipantsList`, `PastLotteryResults`) are now rendering data based on the integrated mock structures.
    *   Basic UI interactions, such as displaying lottery status, viewing participant lists (mocked), seeing past results (mocked), and simulating a lottery entry, have been conceptually tested and appear functional from a UI perspective with the mock data.

## Ongoing Tasks & Current Blockers

1.  **Primary Blocker: Smart Contract Initialization on Devnet:**
    *   **Issue:** We are still unable to successfully execute the `initializeConfig` instruction on the deployed smart contract (Program ID: `58Tp7nzzrUej7RTdWGSavSdGp1YHArexN19pYFnTABxv`) via our TypeScript script (`initializeConfigScript_InitializeConfig.ts`). The persistent `TS2353` error related to the `lotteryConfig` account in the `.accounts` call remains unresolved despite numerous attempts.
    *   **Impact:** This prevents the creation of the `LotteryConfig` account on-chain, which is a prerequisite for all other smart contract interactions (starting rounds, entering lottery, drawing winners).
    *   **Next Step (from proposed alternatives):** Alice (Smart Contract Developer) will now attempt to initialize the contract by adapting the existing Anchor test script (`solana_lottery_contract.ts`), as this environment might handle type interpretations differently or more robustly. This is outlined as the primary recommendation in `alternative_testnet_deployment_approaches.md`.

## Impact on Timeline

The inability to initialize the smart contract on the Devnet directly impacts the timeline for:
*   Task 2.2: Smart Contract Initialization on Testnet (Blocked)
*   Task 2.3: Frontend Live Data Integration (Blocked, as live data depends on initialized contract)
*   Task 2.4: Integrated System Testing on Testnet (Blocked)

While frontend development (Task 2.3.1) has progressed well with mock data, the overall Sprint 2 goal of having a fully integrated system on testnet is currently delayed.

## Next Steps for Sprint 2

1.  **Resolve Smart Contract Initialization (High Priority):** Alice and Frank will focus on implementing the recommended alternative approach (using/adapting Anchor test scripts) to initialize the `LotteryConfig` on Devnet.
2.  **Continue Frontend Refinement (Parallel):** Bob will continue to refine the frontend UI/UX based on the mock data integration, ensuring all components are robust and user-friendly.
3.  **Prepare for Integration:** Once the smart contract is initialized, Bob will switch the frontend from mock data to live data fetching hooks.
4.  **Conduct Integrated System Testing:** After successful initialization and frontend integration, Charlie and Dana will perform thorough end-to-end testing on the Devnet.

We will keep you updated on the progress of resolving the smart contract initialization blocker.
