## Integrated System Testing Strategy - Solana Lottery Application

**Objective:** To comprehensively test the fully integrated Solana Weekly Lottery application (frontend + testnet-deployed smart contract) to ensure all components work together as expected, identify bugs, verify security, and validate user experience before considering mainnet deployment.

**Scope:** This strategy covers end-to-end testing of all user stories and system functionalities defined in the project requirements and design documents.

**Testing Environment:**

*   **Blockchain:** Solana Testnet (e.g., Devnet). The smart contract must be deployed and initialized as per `smart_contract_testnet_deployment_plan.md`.
*   **Frontend:** The Next.js application running locally or deployed to a staging environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and configured to interact with the testnet.
*   **Wallets:** Multiple Phantom wallets (or other supported wallets if added) funded with testnet SOL and SPL tokens (if applicable for future features).
*   **Browsers:** Latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on desktop and mobile.

**Testing Team:**

*   Dev 1 (Alice - Smart Contract): Focus on smart contract interactions, on-chain state verification.
*   Dev 2 (Bob - Frontend): Focus on UI/UX, frontend logic, and API communication with the smart contract.
*   Dev 3 (Charlie - QA/Testing Lead): Oversee test case execution, bug tracking, and reporting.
*   Other Devs (Dana, Eve, Frank): Participate in testing various scenarios.

**Types of Testing:**

1.  **Functional Testing:**
    *   Verify all specified functionalities work as intended.
    *   Test cases will be derived from user stories and system requirements.
2.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Focus on the interaction between the frontend and the smart contract.
    *   Verify data consistency between on-chain state and frontend display.
    *   Test transaction submission, confirmation, and error handling across the system.
3.  **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Testing:**
    *   Ensure the UI is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
    *   Verify the application flow is logical and easy for users to navigate.
    *   Check for consistency in design elements and terminology.
4.  **Security Testing (High-Level for this phase, deeper audit later):**
    *   Verify admin controls: Only authorized admin can execute admin functions (`update_config`, `start_new_lottery_round`, `conduct_draw`, `distribute_prizes`).
    *   Test against common vulnerabilities (e.g., re-entrancy if applicable, though less common with Solana's model, input validation).
    *   Ensure wallet interactions are secure and user funds are handled correctly (within the scope of the lottery logic).
    *   Verify fee calculations and distributions are accurate.
5.  **Performance Testing (Basic):**
    *   Assess frontend responsiveness under normal load.
    *   Monitor transaction confirmation times on the testnet.
    *   Identify any obvious performance bottlenecks in data fetching or UI rendering.
6.  **Compatibility Testing:**
    *   Test on different browsers and devices (desktop, mobile) to ensure consistent functionality and display.

**Key Test Scenarios (Examples - to be expanded into detailed test cases):**

*   **Lottery Lifecycle:**
    *   **Initialization:** Admin initializes `LotteryConfig` successfully.
    *   **Round Start:** Admin starts a new lottery round; frontend updates to show the active round, entry fee, end time.
    *   **User Entry:**
        *   User connects wallet.
        *   User views lottery details (pot, time left, entry fee).
        *   User successfully enters the lottery; entry fee is deducted; participant list updates (after refresh/poll); user's entry count updates.
        *   User attempts to enter with insufficient SOL; transaction fails gracefully with a clear message.
        *   User attempts to enter after the round has ended; transaction fails.
        *   Multiple users enter the lottery.
    *   **Draw Conduction:**
        *   Admin triggers `conduct_draw` after `endTime` has passed and entries exist.
        *   Winners are selected according to the defined logic (randomness source to be noted).
        *   Frontend updates to show the draw has occurred and potentially the winning numbers/addresses (if applicable before distribution).
        *   Attempting to conduct draw before `endTime` or with no participants fails.
    *   **Prize Distribution:**
        *   Admin triggers `distribute_prizes` after a successful draw.
        *   Prizes (50% to main winner, 10% to 4 others, 10% to dev wallet) are correctly transferred to winner wallets and the development fee wallet.
        *   Frontend updates to show winners and prize amounts.
        *   Verify balances of winner wallets and dev wallet on the explorer.
    *   **Post-Distribution:** System is ready for a new round to be started.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Admin updates `LotteryConfig` (e.g., entry fee, dev wallet); changes are reflected in subsequent rounds/actions.
    *   Admin pauses/unpauses the lottery; entry is disabled/enabled accordingly.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Wallet connection/disconnection flow is smooth.
    *   All data displays (pot, time, participants, past results) are accurate and update correctly.
    *   Responsive design works across different screen sizes.
    *   Error messages are clear and helpful.
    *   Loading states are informative.
*   **Security (Scenario-based):**
    *   Non-admin user attempts to call admin functions; transactions fail.
    *   Attempt to manipulate entry data or draw process (where possible within testnet constraints).

**Test Data Requirements:**

*   Multiple testnet wallet addresses (for admin, users, winners, dev fee receiver).
*   Sufficient testnet SOL in each wallet.
*   Pre-defined scenarios for entry amounts, number of participants, etc.

**Test Execution Process:**

1.  **Test Case Preparation:** Develop detailed test cases based on the scenarios above, including steps, expected results, and actual results columns.
2.  **Environment Setup:** Ensure the testnet environment is ready, smart contract deployed and initialized, frontend accessible.
3.  **Test Execution:** Execute test cases systematically. Record results, including screenshots/videos for failures.
4.  **Bug Reporting:** Log all identified defects in a bug tracking system (e.g., Jira, Trello, or a shared document if simpler for the team). Include steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.
5.  **Bug Triage & Fixing:** Development team reviews, prioritizes, and fixes bugs.
6.  **Regression Testing:** Re-test fixed bugs and affected areas of the application to ensure fixes are effective and no new issues were introduced.
7.  **Test Reporting:** Summarize test execution status, number of bugs found/fixed/open, and overall system stability.

**Tools:**

*   **Solana Explorer (Devnet):** For verifying on-chain transactions and account states.
*   **Browser Developer Tools:** For inspecting frontend elements, console logs, and network requests.
*   **Phantom Wallet (or similar):** For interacting with the dApp.
*   **Shared Document/Spreadsheet:** For test case management and bug tracking (if a dedicated tool isn't used).

**Success Criteria:**

*   All critical and high-priority functional test cases pass.
*   No major security vulnerabilities identified that could lead to loss of funds or unauthorized control.
*   The application is stable and performs adequately on the testnet.
*   User experience is deemed acceptable by the team.
*   A high percentage (e.g., >95%) of all test cases pass.

**Deliverables:**

*   Completed Test Case document with execution results.
*   Bug Report Log.
*   Final Test Summary Report, including recommendations for the next steps (e.g., further optimization, readiness for a broader beta, or mainnet considerations after a formal audit).
