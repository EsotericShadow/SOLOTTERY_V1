## Development Timeline: Sprint 2 and Beyond - Solana Lottery Application

**Objective:** To outline the estimated timeline for Sprint 2 development activities and provide a high-level projection for subsequent sprints leading to a production-ready application.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Team Availability:** The virtual development team (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dana, Eve, Frank) continues with their assigned roles and availability.
*   **Sprint Length:** Sprints are approximately 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of tasks. For planning, we'll use a flexible approach, focusing on task completion.
*   **Dependencies:** Successful completion of prior tasks (e.g., smart contract deployment before frontend integration).
*   **No Major Blockers:** Assumes no significant unforeseen technical hurdles that drastically alter timelines. The sandbox limitations encountered in Sprint 1 for local building are expected to be bypassed by moving to a live testnet.
